"This project":http://github.com/phunt/favro fuzzes avro by generating a schema and then using it to perform RPCs.

h3. What's Apache ZooKeeper?

From the "official site":http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/: "ZooKeeper is a high-performance coordination service for distributed applications."

It exposes common services - such as naming, configuration management, synchronization, and group services - in a simple interface so you don't have to write them from scratch. You can use it off-the-shelf to implement consensus, group management, leader election, and presence protocols.

There are two main components, the fuzzer and the tester. The fuzzer generates schemas, the tester validates the schema, noting any failures (RPC inputs, schema that failed, error, etc...).
